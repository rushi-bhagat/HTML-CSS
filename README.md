# HTML-CSS
What I learnt from this course,

  - The basic tags of HTML
  - The basic working flow of CSS and how CSS can change the overall look of the webpage/website.
  - The main part that I actually gained from this course is how Bootstrap can be used with HTML and CSS to make the webpage responsive, which I practically implemented.
  - I have made the cheatsheets of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap with the help of Crash Course alotted.
  - For the given exercise, I have mainly tried to use Bootstrap as much as possible and hence ended up using very minimal amount of CSS.
